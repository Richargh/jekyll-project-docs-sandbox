= Jekyll Project Docs (Sandbox)

A sandbox to play around in and use Jekyll for project documentation.

== Usage

There are two ways to use this template: check that it works locally with a local Jekyll installation or push it to Github directly :) 
If you do decide to publish to Github-Pages you need to enable it in your Github Repository Settings and for source pick `master branch /docs folder`.

=== Local

. link:https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/[Install Ruby] version 2.4.0 or above (check with `ruby -v`). I had a lot of fun with this one because macOS comes with an old Ruby version. [Rubyenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#installation) did wonders for me (you can skip these steps if you use rbenv or don't want to):
    * `brew install rbenv`  
    * `rbenv init`  
    * Close terminal  
    * `which ruby` should now point to _~/.rbenv/shims/ruby_  
    * `rbenv install -v 2.6.3`
    * `rbenv local 2.6.3`
    * `ruby -v` should now be 2.6.3 for this directory  
. Go into the docs directory
  `cd docs`
. Install all gems:
  `bundle`
. Build the site and make it available on a local server:
  `bundle exec jekyll serve`
. Now browse to http://localhost:4000

=== Github

Github uses Jekyll to render static site content for Github-Pages. Content in a top-level _docs folder_ or in a _branch gh-pages_ is automatically rendered.

Github does not support all Jekyll plugins however and only supports those it has whitelisted. If you want asciidoc rendering, you need to put it some effort because that plugin is not whitelisted (21. 8. 2019). Because Github does not support it, you need to **set up your own Jekyll** in your build pipeline and render the content yourself.

== Project Creation

* `mkdir -p <project>/docs`
* `cd <project>`
* `rbenv local 2.6.3`
* `cd docs`
* `jekyll new .`
* Read link:https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/[Minimal Mistakes Quickstart]
* `vim Gemfile` and replace `gem "minima", "~> 2.5"` with `gem "minimal-mistakes-jekyll"`

== About Jekyll
